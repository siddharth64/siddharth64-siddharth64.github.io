Hi! I am a graduate student at the Univeristy of Rochester. I'm broadly interested in homotopy theory, category theory and algebraic topology. I am currently reading/thinking about infinity cateogories as a launch-pad for Higher Algebra.

You can find my CV [here](siddharth64.github.io/files/CV.pdf). This was last updated in January 2021.
I occasionally also think about automated theorem proving. 

When I'm not doing math, odds are I'm playing either chess or Age of Empires II.
