These talks were given as part of courses or seminars.
Handwritten notes which were written down as a part of the talks are attached, but are missing quite a bit of the context which was provided verbally. Not particularly useful.

1. [A categorical version of Brown's Representability Theorem](http://siddharth64.github.io/files/A categoircal version of Brown's representability.pdf): Based on Heller's paper.
2. [Elementary Topoi.pdf](siddharth64.github.io/files/Elementary Topoi.pdf): A basic introduction to Elementary topi, generalized elements and Lawvere's ETCS.  

3. [Hilbert's 17th problem](siddharth64.github.io/files/Hilbert's 17th problem.pdf): Based off of the proof given in Marker's **Model Theory: An Introduction." This was a collaborative talk, but this just includes my part in it.

4. [The Joyal Model structure on simplicial sets](siddharth64.github.io/files/The Joyal Model structure.pdf): Based on Chris Kapulkin's notes on higher category theory.
